Next Tasks:

Bugs:

- belts are able to get items from adjacent belts that don't have an output in their direction, implement
if the item is unable to progress in the correct direction
- belt preview sometimes stays red if on existing belt and then rotated. Should turn green as soon as 
direction is different to buit belt
- preview not refreshed often enough. if you move mouse fast, preview gets rendered to seldom
- rotating while drag placing belts is ... interesting
