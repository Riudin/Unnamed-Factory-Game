Features:

- implement belt merging

Next Tasks:

- set visuals again
- set output arrow correctly again
- set toolbar selection highlight correctly again

Bugs:

- belt preview stays red if on existing belt and then rotated. Should turn green as soon as direction is different to buit belt
- preview not refreshed often enough. if you move mouse fast, preview gets rendered to seldom
- none, perfect game.
